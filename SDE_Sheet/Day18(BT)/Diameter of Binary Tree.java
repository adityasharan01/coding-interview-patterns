Instead of calculating the height of the left and the right subtree for every node in the tree, get the height in constant time.
The idea is to start from the bottom of the tree and return the height of the subtree rooted at a given node to its parent.
The height of a subtree rooted at any node is one more than the maximum height of the left or right subtree.
  

A simple solution would be to calculate the left and right subtreeâ€™s height for each node in the tree. The maximum node path
 that passes through a node will have a value one more than the sum of the height of its left and right subtree.
  Finally, the diameter is maximum among all maximum node paths  for every node in the tree. The time complexity of this solution is 
   as there are  nodes in the tree, and for every node, we are calculating the height of its left and right subtree that takes O(n)  time.
