A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
Example 2:

Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
Example 3:

Input: s = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.
The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> "10" and 'T' -> "20", neither of which start with 0.
Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.
Example 4:

Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).
  
  I wrote some notes for myself reference, hope it might help someone to understand this solution.

dp[i]: represents possible decode ways to the ith char(include i), whose index in string is i-1

Base case: dp[0] = 1 is just for creating base; dp[1], when there's one character, if it is not zero, it can only be 1 decode way. If it is 0, there will be no decode ways.

Here only need to look at at most two digits before i, cuz biggest valid code is 26, which has two digits.

For dp[i]: to avoid index out of boundry, extract substring of (i-1,i)- which is the ith char(index in String is i-1) and substring(i-2, i)

First check if substring (i-1,i) is 0 or not. If it is 0, skip it, continue right to check substring (i-2,i), cuz 0 can only be decode by being together with the char before 0.

Second, check if substring (i-2,i) falls in 10~26. If it does, means there are dp[i-2] more new decode ways.

Time: should be O(n), where n is the length of String
Space: should be O(n), where n is the length of String

avoid the confusion of dp[0] = 1

I used a dp array of size n + 1 to save subproblem solutions. dp[0] means an empty string will have one way to decode, dp[1] means the way to decode a string of size 1. I then check one digit and two digit combination and save the results along the way. In the end, dp[n] will be the end result.

public class Solution {
    public int numDecodings(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int n = s.length();
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = s.charAt(0) != '0' ? 1 : 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int first = Integer.valueOf(s.substring(i - 1, i));
            int second = Integer.valueOf(s.substring(i - 2, i));
            if (first >= 1 && first <= 9) {
               dp[i] += dp[i-1];  
            }
            if (second >= 10 && second <= 26) {
                dp[i] += dp[i-2];
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
