Sort Colors
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 4:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is 0, 1, or 2.
 

Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
  
  The idea is to sweep all 0s to the left and all 2s to the right, then all 1s are left in the middle.

It is hard to define what is a "one-pass" solution but this algorithm is bounded by O(2n), meaning that at most each element will be seen and operated twice (in the case of all 0s). You may be able to write an algorithm which goes through the list only once, but each step requires multiple operations, leading the total operations larger than O(2n).

    class Solution {
    public:
        void sortColors(int A[], int n) {
            int second=n-1, zero=0;
            for (int i=0; i<=second; i++) {
                while (A[i]==2 && i<second) swap(A[i], A[second--]);
                while (A[i]==0 && i>zero) swap(A[i], A[zero++]);
            }
        }
    };


// 2pass solution 
public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
    // 2-pass
    int count0 = 0, count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] == 0) {count0++;}
        if (nums[i] == 1) {count1++;}
        if (nums[i] == 2) {count2++;}
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (i < count0) {nums[i] = 0;}
        else if (i < count0 + count1) {nums[i] = 1;}
        else {nums[i] = 2;}
    }
}
