Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
 //Approach1:
  public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character,Integer> indices = new HashMap<Character,Integer>();
        int length = 0;
        int start = -1;
        int end = 0;
        for(end=0; end < s.length(); end++){
            char c = s.charAt(end);
            if(indices.containsKey(c)){
                int newstart = indices.get(c);
                start = Math.max(start,newstart);
            }
            length = Math.max(length,end-start);
            indices.put(c,end);
        }
        return length;
    }
}
  
 //Approach2: The idea is use a hash set to track the longest substring without repeating characters so far, use a fast pointer j to see if character j is in the hash set or not, if not, great, add it to the hash set, move j forward and update the max length, otherwise, delete from the head by using a slow pointer i until we can put character j to the hash set.

public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    int i = 0, j = 0, max = 0;
    Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    
    while (j < s.length()) {
        if (!set.contains(s.charAt(j))) {
            set.add(s.charAt(j++));
            max = Math.max(max, set.size());
        } else {
            set.remove(s.charAt(i++));
        }
    }
    
    return max;
}
