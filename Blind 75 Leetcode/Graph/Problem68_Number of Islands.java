Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
  
  Java Solution 1 - DFS

The basic idea of the following solution is merging adjacent lands, and the merging should be done recursively.

Each element is visited once only. So time is O(m*n).

public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
    if(grid==null || grid.length==0||grid[0].length==0)
        return 0;
 
    int m = grid.length;
    int n = grid[0].length;
 
    int count=0;
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
        for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
            if(grid[i][j]=='1'){
                count++;
                merge(grid, i, j);
            }
        }
    }
 
    return count;
}
 
public void merge(char[][] grid, int i, int j){
    int m=grid.length;
    int n=grid[0].length;
 
    if(i<0||i>=m||j<0||j>=n||grid[i][j]!='1')
        return;
 
    grid[i][j]='X';
 
    merge(grid, i-1, j);
    merge(grid, i+1, j);
    merge(grid, i, j-1);
    merge(grid, i, j+1);
}
