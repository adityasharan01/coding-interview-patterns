Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?


//Approach 1: Hello! At first glance, this can easily be solved through a quadratic algorithm BUT it can actually be done in linear time. The idea here is to use a map to keep track of the needed RIGHT operand in order for the sum to meet its target. So, we iterate through the array, and store the index of the LEFT operand as the value in the map whereas the NEEDED RIGHT operand is used as the key. When we do encounter the right operand somewhere in the array, the answer is considered to be found! We just return the indices as instructed. :]

//Feel free to let me know should you have any queries for me OR if this can be improved upon!

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> tracker = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        int len = nums.length;
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
            if(tracker.containsKey(nums[i])){
                int left = tracker.get(nums[i]);
                return new int[]{left+1, i+1};
            }else{
                tracker.put(target - nums[i], i);
            }
        }
        return new int[2];
    }
