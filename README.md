# Leetcode Solutions
The repository full of solutions to questions hosted on [Leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com/) along with data structures in Python,So that one can simply understand how all data structure works and build up.

It is **NOT** advisable to directly copy and paste the solution and make them work for you, but I would recommend you to first try out finding right, efficient and optimized solution by yourself and in case after a lot of tries you are unable to do so then you can anyday take help from this repository.

You can come and say thanks for compiling all these for you at - [Contact](mailto:ranjan.aditya2009@gmail.com)
