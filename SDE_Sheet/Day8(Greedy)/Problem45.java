Fractional Knapsack 
Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item. 
Example 1:

Input:
N = 3, W = 50
values[] = {60,100,120}
weight[] = {10,20,30}
Output:
240.00
Explanation:Total maximum value of item
we can have is 240.00 from the given
capacity of sack. 
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2, W = 50
values[] = {60,100}
weight[] = {10,20}
Output:
160.00
Explanation:
Total maximum value of item
we can have is 160.00 from the given
capacity of sack.
  
 A brute-force solution would be to try all possible subset with all different fraction but that will be too much time taking. 




An efficient solution is to use Greedy approach. The basic idea of the greedy approach is to calculate the ratio value/weight for each item and sort the item on basis of this ratio. Then take the item with the highest ratio and add them until we canâ€™t add the next item as a whole and at the end add the next item as much as we can. Which will always be the optimal solution to this problem.
A simple code with our own comparison function can be written as follows, please see sort function more closely, the third argument to sort function is our comparison function which sorts the item according to value/weight ratio in non-decreasing order. 
After sorting we need to loop over these items and add them in our knapsack satisfying above-mentioned criteria.
